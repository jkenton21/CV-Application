# CV Application Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

This application allows the user to generate a Curriculum Vitae (CV).
It displays a form with information for the user to fill out such as educational data, work experience, and personal contact information.

The application will then compile this data into a usable CV template.

The form will allow the user to edit, delete, or add more data to be used in the CV.
